Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a junior double majoring in Data Science and Economics. Can't live without two things: pizza and Gordon Ramsay. I enjoy playing chess, tennis, and cooking in my spare time! Professionally, my interests lie at the intersection of technology and finance - be it machine learning, behavioral economics, or entrepreneurship. Always ready to help you succeed and looking forward to getting to know you all through office hours! (P.S, if you didn't already know, this is my favorite class at Berkeley)
